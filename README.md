# NuxtJS Developer Challenge

## Introduction

Welcome to our NuxtJS challenge! We have a partially implemented product management application built with NuxtJS and tRPC. 
The application aims to display a list of products and allow users to add new products. 
However, it's currently non-functional and requires your expertise to complete and enhance it.

## Background

A former colleague began developing this application but departed before its completion. 
Now, we need you to finish the implementation and add new features, particularly multi-language support.

## Core Challenge

Your primary tasks are to:

1. Complete the implementation of the product list display functionality.
2. Implement the ability to add new products.
3. Integrate multi-language support for English, Spanish, and French.
4. Identify and fix any existing bugs in the codebase.

## Requirements

### Mandatory
- Implement a functioning product list display.
- Create a working feature to add new products.
- Integrate language switching capability between English, Spanish, and French.
- Ensure the application is free of obvious bugs and errors.
- Provide comprehensive documentation of your changes, including rationale for key decisions.

### Optional (Bonus Points)
- Implement localization for product listings, displaying product information in the selected language.
- Enable adding products with localized information based on the current language setting.

## Evaluation Criteria

We will assess your submission based on:

1. Code quality and organization
2. Problem-solving approach
3. Effective use of NuxtJS and tRPC
4. Implementation of TypeScript
5. Attention to detail in bug fixing
6. Quality and clarity of documentation
7. User experience considerations
8. Performance optimizations
9. Creative solutions to the optional challenges

## Submission

Please provide:

1. The complete source code of your implementation.
2. A README file detailing:
   - Your approach to solving the challenge
   - Any assumptions you made
   - Instructions for running the application
   - A list of known issues or areas for improvement (if any)
3. Any additional notes or explanations you feel are relevant

We're excited to see your solution! Good luck!
